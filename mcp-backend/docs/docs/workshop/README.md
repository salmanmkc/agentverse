# 🚀 Mission Control for the Mars Colony - AI Platform Engineering Workshop


**Get ready to ⚡ level up with [Community AI Platform Engineering](https://cnoe-io.github.io/ai-platform-engineering/) in this hands-on workshop where you'll explore, run, modify, deploy, and master Outshift's open-source, secure, enterprise-ready, distributed multi-agent system.**

---

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

This jam-style session is all about exploration, learning, and hands-on deployment. You'll:

- 🚀 **Explore and run** the full-stack AI agentic platform on your own laptop or environment
- 🧪 **Play with real-world use cases**, experiment with tools, and customize agents by modifying prompts
- 🔍 **Learn distributed tracing**, continuous evaluation, and best practices for agent evaluation
- 🤝 **Collaborate with the creators** of JARVIS and the open-source community to shape the AI Platform Engineering Agentic future
- ☸️ **Deploy the Full-Stack AI Platform Engineering** on Kubernetes and take it to Production for enterprise use cases

---

## 🎯 Workshop Mission

After months of preparation, your crew has finally landed on Mars 🟠. Now it's time to establish Mission Control operations with Agentic AI 📡🤖🚀 to keep the colony running smoothly.

### Your Mission

Set up 🛰️ communication and 🌦️ weather monitoring systems to support life in the new habitat, while staying connected to Earth 🌍 with regular updates on your progress. Most importantly, bring up the full **CAIPE system** — your command center for running Mission Control — so every operation is coordinated, automated, and mission-ready.

---

## 🏗️ What is CAIPE?

**[Community AI Platform Engineering (CAIPE)](https://cnoe-io.github.io/ai-platform-engineering)** (pronounced as `cape`) is an open-source, Multi-Agentic AI System (MAS) supported by the [CNOE (Cloud Native Operational Excellence)](https://cnoe.io) forum.

CAIPE provides a secure, scalable, persona-driven reference implementation with built-in knowledge base retrieval that streamlines platform operations, accelerates workflows, and fosters innovation for modern engineering teams.

### 🌟 Why "CAIPE"?

Just as a 🦸‍♂️ cape empowers a superhero, CAIPE empowers platform engineers with 🤖 Agentic AI automation! 🚀
