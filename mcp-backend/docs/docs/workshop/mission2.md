# Mission Check 2 — Run Standalone Petstore Agent

## Overview

🚀 **Mission Status**: As a newly arrived Mars Inhabitant, your first assignment is to manage the colony's biological companions and supply systems.

In this mission, you'll deploy a standalone Petstore AI agent to handle critical colony operations:

* **🐾 Companion Management**: Track, care for, and manage colony animals that boost morale and assist with tasks
* **📦 Supply Operations**: Monitor inventory, process resource orders, and analyze colony logistics
* **👨‍🚀 Inhabitant Management**: Maintain records and manage access for fellow Mars inhabitants
* **🔍 Smart Search**: Efficiently locate animals and supplies using advanced filtering systems
* **⚡ Response Optimization**: Handle large datasets crucial for colony survival without system overload

## Architecture Overview

The petstore agent can run in two different MCP (Model Control Protocol) modes, each with distinct advantages:

### Key Differences Between the Modes



| Mode | How it Works | Benefits |
|------|--------------|----------|
| 🔗 **STDIO** | The agent starts its own MCP server process and communicates directly through simple text commands (like a conversation through a pipe). | • Faster communication (no network delays) • Everything runs in one place • Simpler setup for development • No authentication needed |
| 🌐 **HTTP** | The agent connects to a separate MCP server running elsewhere using web requests (like calling an API over the internet). | • MCP server can serve multiple agents • Better for production deployments • Can scale components independently • Supports authentication and security |

The following diagrams illustrate how the chat client connects to the petstore agent in each mode:

| **STDIO Mode** | **HTTP Mode** |

> **📝 NOTE:** If you prefer to build and run the agent locally, refer to the step at the bottom of this page: [Optional Step 3: Build and run the petstore agent locally](#build-and-run-the-petstore-agent-locally).

## Step 1: Navigate to AI Platform Engineering Repository

```bash
cd $HOME/work/ai-platform-engineering
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

---

### 2.1: Copy the example environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2.2: Edit the environment file with your LLM credentials

For this workshop, we will use Azure OpenAI. The API credentials are available in the `.env_vars` file in your home directory. Run below command in the terminal to source the variables from `.env_vars` and update the `.env` file you just created:

```bash
source $HOME/.env_vars && \
sed -i \
  -e 's|^LLM_PROVIDER=.*|LLM_PROVIDER=azure-openai|' \
  -e "s|^AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=.*|AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=${AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY}|" \
  -e "s|^AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=.*|AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=${AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}|" \
  -e "s|^AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=.*|AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=${AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT}|" \
  -e "s|^AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=.*|AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=${AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION}|" \
  .env
```

**💡 Tip:** Check if your Azure credentials are set in your .env

```bash
cat .env | grep -Ei 'azure|llm' | sed -E 's/(=.{5}).+/\1****/'
```

Alternatively, you can also check the variables have been set correctly in the `.env` file by going to the IDE tab on the top right of this page and locating the file under `ai-platform-engineering/` directory.

## Step 3: Run the Petstore Agent

**💡 Mode Selection Tip:**
- Use **STDIO mode** for local development and testing with minimal overhead
- Use **HTTP mode** for production environments or when you need to connect to remotely hosted MCP servers

You can run the petstore agent in two different MCP (Model Control Protocol) modes. For this workshop, we will use the HTTP mode but you can also use the STDIO mode if you prefer (see [Step 7: [Optional] Using MCP STDIO Mode](#step-7-optional-using-mcp-stdio-mode)).

### 3.1: Using Remote MCP Streamable HTTP Mode

HTTP mode enables network-based communication with remote MCP servers, useful for production deployments or when the MCP server is running separately. In this mode, the agent connects to a separately hosted internal MCP server running at https://petstore.outshift.io/mcp, which then handles the Petstore API operations.

**3.1.1: Set the Petstore API key**

```bash
PETSTORE_MCP_API_KEY=$(echo -n 'caiperocks' | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1) && \
sed -i "s|^PETSTORE_MCP_API_KEY=.*|PETSTORE_MCP_API_KEY=${PETSTORE_MCP_API_KEY}|" .env
```

**3.1.2: Run the petstore agent**

```bash
IMAGE_TAG=latest MCP_MODE=http docker compose -f workshop/docker-compose.mission2.yaml up
```

**What happens:**

- ⏬ Downloads petstore agent image with the latest tag from the registry
- 🌐 Connects to remote MCP server via HTTP/streaming mode at https://petstore.outshift.io/mcp
- 🌐 Exposes agent on `http://localhost:8000`
- 📋 Shows logs directly in terminal
- 🚀 **Advantage**: Supports remote MCP servers, useful for production deployments, better separation of concerns

---

### 3.3: Expected Output (Both Modes)

Regardless of which mode you choose, you should see the following output:

```console
...
===================================
       PETSTORE AGENT CONFIG
===================================
AGENT_URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000
===================================
Running A2A server in p2p mode.
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**🎯 Success indicator:** Ensure you wait until you see the message: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)` regardless of the mode you choose.



## Step 4: Test the Petstore Agent

Open a new terminal and run the following command to test the agent health. You should see the agent card with petstore capabilities. This includes the agent's name, description, and capabilities including example prompts that you can use to test the agent.

**💡 Note:** Click the **+** button on the terminal window to open a **new terminal** before running the following commands.


```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/.well-known/agent.json | jq
```


## Step 5: Connect Chat Client

Once you confirm the agent is running, start the chat client:

```bash
docker run -it --network=host ghcr.io/cnoe-io/agent-chat-cli:stable
```

**💡 Tip:** When asked to `💬 Enter token (optional): `, just press enter ⏎.

In production, your system will use a JWT or Bearer token for authentication here.

![chatcli token](images/chat-cli-token.svg)

The chat client will connect to the petstore agent on port 8000 and download the agent card from Step 4. It will then use the agent card to discover the agent's capabilities.

Wait for the agent's welcome message with example skills and CLI prompt `🧑🧑‍💻 You: `. You can now start interacting with the agent.

## Step 6: Interact with the Petstore Agent

---

### 6.1: Discovery Commands

Try these example interactions:

```bash
What actions can you perform?
```

```bash
Show me what you can do with pets
```

### 6.2: Pet Management Examples

**ℹ️ Info:** HTTP mode persists data so you can try adding pets and then retrieve them. However, STDIO mode uses a demo sandbox where data is not persisted, so create/update/delete operations may not reflect in subsequent reads.

**⚠️ Note (HTTP MCP mode):** All lab users share the **same remote Petstore endpoint**. To avoid collisions, use **unique pet names** and **random pet IDs** when creating new pets.

(Admins will reset the data after the workshop.)




```bash
Find all available pets in the store
```

```bash
Get all cats that are available
```

```bash
Get a summary of pets by status
```

```bash
I want to add a new pet to the store
```

### 6.3: Store Operations

```bash
Check store inventory levels
```

```bash
Show me pets with 'rain proof' tag
```

### Expected Behavior

- ✅ **Fast responses** - Agent uses optimized functions with response limits
- ✅ **Smart search** - Can handle combined criteria like "cats that are pending"
- ✅ **Interactive guidance** - Agent will ask for required details when needed e.g. ask to add a new pet and it will ask for required details like name, category, status, etc.
- ✅ **Rich summaries** - Shows counts and statistics without overwhelming data

## Step 7: [Optional] Using MCP STDIO Mode

STDIO mode runs the MCP server embedded within the agent container, using standard input/output streams for internal communication. The embedded MCP server then connects to the external Petstore API.

**📝 Note:** If you are already running the agent in HTTP mode, first stop the docker compose:

```bash
docker compose -f $HOME/work/ai-platform-engineering/workshop/docker-compose.mission2.yaml down
```

```bash
IMAGE_TAG=latest MCP_MODE=stdio docker compose -f workshop/docker-compose.mission2.yaml up
```

**What happens:**

- ⏬ Downloads petstore agent image with the latest tag from the registry
- 🔗 Connects to MCP server via STDIO mode to https://petstore.swagger.io/v2 which is a public sandbox API
- 🌐 Exposes agent on `http://localhost:8000`
- 📋 Shows logs directly in terminal
- 🚀 **Advantage**: Lower latency, direct process communication

## Step 8: Teardown that agent and chat client

**🛑 Before You Proceed: Bring Down Your Docker Containers**

- **Important:** Run `docker compose down` in your terminal to stop and remove all running containers for this demo before moving on to the next steps.
- This ensures a clean environment and prevents port conflicts or resource issues.

You can stop the agent and chat client by pressing `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on Mac) in each terminal. Or if you have already closed the terminals, ensure you run the specific docker compose down command to make sure the agent has stopped:

```bash
docker compose -f $HOME/work/ai-platform-engineering/workshop/docker-compose.mission2.yaml down
```

---

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you may encounter and how to fix them.

### Agent won't start
```bash
# Check if port 8000 is in use
lsof -i :8000

# Stop any existing containers
make stop
make clean
```

### Chat client can't connect
```bash
# Verify agent health
curl http://localhost:8000/.well-known/agent.json

# Check if agent is running
make status
```

### Environment issues
```bash
# Check environment variables
make show-env

# Rebuild with fresh environment
make run-rebuild
```

## [Optional] Steps 1-3: Build and run the petstore agent locally

---

### Set up environment variables

If you are using your local machine, first get the Azure OpenAI credentials from the lab environment:

```bash
cat $HOME/.env_vars
```

Then run below to copy the example environment file to your local machine and update the `.env` file with the Azure OpenAI credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Build and run the petstore agent locally

You can also build and run the petstore agent locally:

```bash
MCP_MODE=stdio docker compose -f workshop/docker-compose.mission2.yaml -f workshop/docker-compose.dev.override.yaml --profile mission2-dev up
```
**What happens:**

- 🔧 Builds Docker image located in `ai_platform_engineering/agents/template/build/Dockerfile.a2a`
- 📁 Mounts code via volumes for live development
- 🌐 Exposes agent on `http://localhost:8000`
- 📋 Shows logs directly in terminal

Above command uses the dev override file to mount the code from your local machine and rebuild the petstore agent image on each change. This is useful for testing local changes to the agent code. You can now return to [Step 4: Test the Petstore Agent](#step-4-test-the-petstore-agent) to test the agent.
