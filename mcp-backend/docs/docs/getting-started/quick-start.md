# 🚀 Quick Start

One of the fastest ways to get started with *CAIPE* is by running it with Docker or Podman on your laptop or VM. If you have experience with Kubernetes, you may also find the Kind and EKS options convenient.

1. Configure [Agent Secrets](docker-compose/configure-agent-secrets.md) and [LLM Providers](docker-compose/configure-llms.md).
2. Follow the [Docker compose setup instructions](docker-compose/setup.md) to run the platform locally on your laptop or VM.
3. Interact with the agent using the [Agent Chat CLI](user-interfaces.md#agent-chat-cli) or the [Agent Forge Backstage Plugin](user-interfaces.md#agent-forge-backstage-plugin).
