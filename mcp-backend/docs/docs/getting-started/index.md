# Overview

**AI Platform Engineer** is a multi-agent system that streamlines platform operations by integrating with essential engineering tools:

- 🚀 **ArgoCD** for continuous deployment for Kubernetes applications
- 🚨 **PagerDuty** for incident management
- 🐙 **GitHub** for github repos, issues, PRs
- 🗂️ **Jira** for project/task management
- 💬 **Slack** for communication channels

Each tool is managed by a specialized agent that automatically handles user requests—such as acknowledging incidents, merging pull requests, creating Jira tickets, sending Slack messages, and syncing ArgoCD applications.

Just describe your task — **the platform intelligently routes your request to the right agent and tool**, ensuring efficient, reliable execution across your engineering workflows.


> In this guide, you’ll be running the **Platform Engineer** multi-agent system as the baseline example. This setup is designed to showcase core features and integrations for platform operations.
> For additional persona-based use cases (such as SRE, Developer, or custom workflows), please refer to the [usecases](../usecases/platform-engineer.md) section of the documentation.
