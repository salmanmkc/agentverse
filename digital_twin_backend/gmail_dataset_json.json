If you are selected to proceed to the next round interviews, you will be invited back to interview in person on Saturday, November 1st.\r\nPlease review the time slots below and reply all with every slot you are available to interview. Providing all available options will help us schedule efficiently.\r\n\r\nFriday, October 31st\r\nSaturday, November 1st\r\nSlot 1: 9:00 – 10:30 GMT\r\nSlot 1: 9:00 - 10:00 GMT\r\nSlot 2: 10:30 – 12:00 GMT\r\nSlot 2: 10:15 – 11:15 GMT\r\nSlot 3: 13:00 – 14:30 GMT\r\nSlot 3: 11:30 – 12:30 GMT\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   This interview will be an Analytics Discussion Group. In Investment Analytics, we deal with many complex theoretical problems with no clear right or wrong answer. The goal of the Discussion Group interview is to simulate the kind of conversations we’d have around one of these problems. In this interview, we will assess your ability to develop a framework for evaluation of an open-ended question, integrate new ideas into your framework, and weigh tradeoffs when considering how to practically implement your ideas. Our interviewers will ask questions for the group to discuss. An example is: “Is television damaging to society?”.\r\n  *   Please hold a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes for the interview (1 hour 15 minutes for the interview with a 15-minute buffer).\r\n\r\n  *   Someone will be in the lobby of the hotel to greet you and direct you to your interview room. You don't need to be particularly early, but please arrive about five minutes before your designated interview time. \r\n\r\n  *   Dress is code is informal - no need to wear a suit!\r\n\r\n  *   Let us know if you have any competing offers with upcoming deadlines. We will communicate with you on whether you are moving forward to next round interviews by end of day on Friday, October 31st.\r\n\r\n  *   The Investment Associate role requires all candidates to be eligible to participate in our IA Class and subsequent training. This might mean some candidates might be ineligible for the position due to their current immigration status. If you have questions or concerns on this or your qualifications following your interview process, we’d be happy to connect you with our Immigration team.\r\n\r\nSocial Event\r\nWe hope you’ll join us for a social gathering on Thursday evening ahead of the interviews. Come enjoy some appetizers and drinks and get to know several members of our Investment Team.\r\nLocation: The Varsity Club (9A High St, Oxford OX1 4DB, United Kingdom)\r\nTime: Thursday, October 30th, from 6:30–8:30 p.m. GMT — feel free to stop by whenever you can.\r\nDetails: Dress code is casual. All food and beverages will be covered by Bridgewater.\r\n\r\nWe will follow up with confirmation details prior to the interview. If you have any questions, please ‘reply all’ and one of us will get back to you as soon as possible!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nPriscilla\r\n\r\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis message is intended exclusively for the individual(s) or entity to which it is addressed.

It would be very useful to get these out and set the stage for others to use your algorithm for a broader search and classification.\r\n\r\nRegarding the paper, I would recommend you treating it as a report for now. So maybe you can write everything you feel like. After that I will give it a read and ask you questions, which will lead to inclusion or exclusion of contents.\r\n\r\nNo need for polishing language now. I would suggest not to worry about the length, as the reception of the work has nothing to do with it. Moreover, people are more likely to read short and concise papers than long papers. I have done the mistake of packing a lot of stuff in a single paper, and making it long. Then I have seen people missing out sections of the paper. I would thus advise against it.\r\n\r\nI would guess a majority of the paper to be on the selection of the region, analysis of the recovered HASH PNe (understanding any size biases etc, like the plots you have been making) etc. I think we are yet to decide on a well defined region on the sky and run the algorithm? Maybe we can do that.\r\n\r\nRegarding spectroscopy, I am still waiting on the blue channel data (where OIII etc lines lies). NGPS blue side will be on soon, and someone else observed a few of your targets with Keck/LRIS (I am yet to receive the data from them). But I can write it down quickly, whenever I get them.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to get something out before your graduation, so that it helps both with your future applications (job or grad school). I will have enough data over the next year. But we can aim to get the rest of the paper done by then.\r\n\r\nWe can possibly chat a bit and set a timeline? Let me know when you would be free. Absolutely no rush!\r\n\r\nWith regards,\r\nSoumyadeep Bhattacharjee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Oct 27, 2025, at 10:23 AM, Ryan Lin <ryanlin10@gmail.com> wrote:\r\n\r\nHi Soumyadeep,\r\n\r\nHope everything is going well!

We are very grateful to all of you!\r\n\r\nIf you missed the email please see your spam. We sent it via udai@tuki.today. Sending via this account just to make sure we can get passed the spam filter for some of you.\r\n\r\nFor those who are not ware we've been sharing our application system (and fixing bugs and helping lots of people with their applications). *Unless you're really struggling, please apply via the system at* *oxbridgeaichallenge.com* ( http://oxbridgeaichallenge.com/ ) *as well.*\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we as a team will need to manually check and move applications from one system to the other.\r\n\r\n📊 *Explaining Why We’re Asking*\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea: *125 startups applied just via the Typeform alone.* So that can take us up to a day to go through and check before we can start letting judges get access to things. The Oxbridge AI Challenge logistically is a coordinated effort between over 400/500 people. It’s not easy.\r\n\r\n*Need us to share your application with you! No problem!*\r\n\r\nIf you don't remember what you submitted, we can help you - just ask us! We've done this for over 15 startups today. You're already submitted so you didn't miss the deadline. So you’re in already no stress.\r\n\r\n💡 *Think of This as an Opportunity*\r\n\r\nApologies for the inconvenience but this is a chance to improve your application! But no worries if you don't get a chance to. *Any requests to do this after midnight today will not be accepted* and we'll update things to the best of our ability.While you do definitely check out the FAQ!\r\n\r\nApplying via our platform makes it much faster and easier to coordinate with judges and helps us speed things up after the deadline.\r\n\r\n🐛 *Bugs Fixed!*\r\n\r\nFor those who chose to apply via Typeform because of bugs, note we've fixed:\r\n\r\n* ✅ CV upload issues\r\n\r\n* ✅ Pitch deck upload problems\r\n\r\n* ✅ Team joining issues\r\n\r\n* ✅ And more!\r\n\r\n👥 *Team Issues? Here's the Fix*\r\n\r\nIf you or your team members weren't getting emails or struggling to join teams:\r\n\r\n* The owner should *remove them first*\r\n\r\n* Then *send out the invite again*\r\n\r\nIf you're struggling to log in, just refresh and try again.\r\n\r\n📚 *Resources Available*\r\n\r\nThere's an *FAQ link* via the platform and the oxbridgeaichallenge.com ( http://oxbridgeaichallenge.com/ ) page. Please check it out - there's a *rubric* there that might help!\r\n\r\n✨ *Platform Benefits*\r\n\r\n* 🎤 Use *voice to fill things out* (especially useful for dyslexics!)\r\n\r\n* 💾 *Save your progress* as you go\r\n\r\n🙏 *A Note on Quality*\r\n\r\nIt's a bit buggy, but we're getting there. In the words of Reid Hoffman: \"If you're not embarrassed when you launch, then you launched too late.\" I'll let you decide how we've been feeling 😅\r\n\r\n🕐 *Final Reminder*\r\n\r\n*Remember:* If for any reason you decide not to update your application, no worries. We’re still here for you and we'll migrate it for you. But with the number of applications we received via Typeform (125+!), *any help from you would be most appreciated!*\r\n\r\n*Wishing you all the very best of luck!*\r\n\r\nYou've got this, and We've Got Your Back!\r\n\r\nBig hugs,\r\n\r\nUdai and the Oxbridge AI Challenge Team!\r\n\r\nP.S. If you've already done this please ignore!\n--- End Original Email ---\n\n--- Your reply to the original email ---\nHi,\r\n\r\nJust letting you guys know that I submitted my application on the old form a couple weeks ago, so you don't have to crossmatch my submission.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nRyan"

Would a continuous classification\r\n>         (representing some sort of probability/confidence) work better\r\n>         for our purposes?\r\n>\r\n>         - Loss function: Related to the above, what would be the best\r\n>         loss function for either of the two cases? I see Karan uses\r\n>         cross entropy loss for the discrete classification. What would\r\n>         be the best loss function for the continuous case?\r\n>\r\n>         - CNN input size for large scale nebulae: Although most\r\n>         nebulae get captured in 64x64 snippets, quite a significant\r\n>         proportion lie outside of this size. At the moment I've just\r\n>         included cropped images of the larger nebulae in the training\r\n>         data, and hope the model learns to pick up on the features.\r\n>         Should I increase the snippet size 128x128?\r\n>         - GPU: If we were to increase the snippet or model size,\r\n>         computation would start getting longer, especially on the\r\n>         cluster I'm currently using which has no GPU. I was wondering\r\n>         whether there are any remote GPUs/clusters I could use.\r\n>         - Data quality: At the moment my data collection is quite\r\n>         crude. 33% of my snippets are true pne from hash, 33% are\r\n>         random snippets of the background sky, and 33% are false\r\n>         positives picked up from our original algorithm (mostly bad\r\n>         subtractions, other Ha emitters).

I hope to carry on working on the ML side of the project for the time being so we still have time beyond this week!\r\n\r\nI had a few questions that have come up:\r\n\r\n- Continuous/discrete classification: I noticed Karan's classification CNN outputs discrete classifications (rather than continuous [0, 1]). Would a continuous classification (representing some sort of probability/confidence) work better for our purposes?\r\n\r\n- Loss function: Related to the above, what would be the best loss function for either of the two cases? I see Karan uses cross entropy loss for the discrete classification. What would be the best loss function for the continuous case?\r\n\r\n- CNN input size for large scale nebulae: Although most nebulae get captured in 64x64 snippets, quite a significant proportion lie outside of this size. At the moment I've just included cropped images of the larger nebulae in the training data, and hope the model learns to pick up on the features. Should I increase the snippet size 128x128?[cid:3c05fec6-cf27-44e4-a072-cd7f92142884]\r\n- GPU: If we were to increase the snippet or model size, computation would start getting longer, especially on the cluster I'm currently using which has no GPU. I was wondering whether there are any remote GPUs/clusters I could use.\r\n- Data quality: At the moment my data collection is quite crude. 33% of my snippets are true pne from hash, 33% are random snippets of the background sky, and 33% are false positives picked up from our original algorithm (mostly bad subtractions, other Ha emitters). I was wondering whether you had insight into constructing a higher quality dataset.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nRyan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n--- End Original Email ---\n\n--- Your reply to the original email ---\nHi Ashish,\r\n\r\nWas wondering whether you had any thoughts about this.

This could be a glitch in the website?\r\n\r\nI was also wondering whether we could load the following candidates to a separate page (or add a button that allows us to select what objects we want to view) to avoid confusion with the prior candidates (so something like before doesn't happen again). Open to any other suggestions though.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have stored the image files for each run in different folders, so it may be easier to create a separate webpage for each run.\r\n\r\nFor the RA 270-285 DEC minus 15 - 0 run, the image directory is:\r\n/scr2/rxlin/old_code/pne_images_ra270p0to285p0_decminus15p0to0p0\r\nwith the respective csv file attached below. This uses my new crosschecking algorithm so there should be significantly fewer junks.\r\n\r\nFor the RA 240-310 DEC 10-30 run, the image directory is:\r\n/scr2/rxlin/old_code/pne_images_ra240p0to310p0_dec10p0to30p0\r\nwith two respective csv file attached below (the one starting with pne_candidates is the file generated from the vanilla run and the one starting with crosschecker is the file generated after passing through my crosschecking algorithm).\r\n\r\nMy crosschecking algorithm is still running for this field and I have attached the results its generated thus far.

Image directory: /scr2/rxlin/old_code/pne_images_ra310p0to360p0_dec0p0to20p0\r\n\r\nI realised made some slight errors with the run region diagram I made earlier. The corrected one is attached. Soumyadeep and I decided to perform the next run in the region labelled run 5. The crosschecker for this region is running overnight and should be done tomorrow.\r\n\r\nJust a few questions too:\r\n\r\n- Soumyadeep and I were wondering how your HASH database query on the website worked. In particular, what version and kind of the HASH database is it using, and what do all the possible symbols mean. We've noticed cases where objects are showing up on the HASH database when they haven't been decisively classified as planetary nebulae (e.g. HH)\r\n\r\n- Particularly at low galactic lattitudes, large nebula structures are a major source of junk. To classify these faster I was wondering whether you could add a new feature on the website: add zoomed out (400x400 pixels?) Ha1 images for each candidate.\r\n\r\n- I noticed the Ha1 and Ha2 stacks are gone from the website. Could these be added again. We can perhaps replace the Ha3 and Ha4 stacks with these since Ha1 and Ha2 are more important for our purposes.\r\n\r\n- There have been cases where we have an obvious planetary nebula candidate is not on the HASH database, however have been classified by either Gaia or Simbad as some other object. I was wondering how reliable Gaia and Simbad are? Do they use automated classification? How frequent do they classify real PNe as other objects like Y*, Be*, HS, Mi, Eb, Em*?\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nRyan"

This could be a glitch in the website?\r\n\r\nI was also wondering whether we could load the following candidates to a separate page (or add a button that allows us to select what objects we want to view) to avoid confusion with the prior candidates (so something like before doesn't happen again). Open to any other suggestions though.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have stored the image files for each run in different folders, so it may be easier to create a separate webpage for each run.\r\n\r\nFor the RA 270-285 DEC minus 15 - 0 run, the image directory is:\r\n\r\n/scr2/rxlin/old_code/pne_images_ra270p0to285p0_decminus15p0to0p0\r\n\r\nwith the respective csv file attached below. This uses my new crosschecking algorithm so there should be significantly fewer junks.\r\n\r\nFor the RA 240-310 DEC 10 -30 run, the image directory is:\r\n\r\n/scr2/rxlin/old_code/pne_images_ra240p0to310p0_dec10p0to30p0\r\n\r\nwith two respective csv file attached below (the one starting with pne_candidates is the file generated from the vanilla run and the one starting with crosschecker is the file generated after passing through my crosschecking algorithm).\r\n\r\nMy crosschecking algorithm is still running for this field and I have attached the results its generated thus far. I tweaked the detection thresholds in the vanilla run hence why the number of candidates in the vanilla run cvs file is so large (~15000). This has improved completeness to around 60%. The hope is that the crosschecker algorithm will significantly bring down the total candidate number (empirically it has only retained 4.43% of candidates in the vanilla csv file so far) whilst leaving true PNe untouched.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nRyan"

These images contain \r\n> four narrowband H-alpha filters for each part of the sky.\r\n>\r\nYes. Please mention how many are known, and how many are expected of the \r\ndifferent subtypes, and some stats on sizes (in terms of major/minor axes).\r\n\r\n> - Segment anything model (SAM) is too slow to be used effectively\r\n>\r\nWith a GPU it should be fast. We should try that before excluding.\r\n\r\n> - We will use a CNN (or some other better performing architecture) \r\n> instead, taking 64x64 pixel images as input, outputting either a \r\n> probability or binary outcome (0, 1), corresponding to whether the \r\n> image contains a planetary nebula.\r\n>\r\n[0,1] (to include 0 and 1.\r\n\r\n> - The CNN will take 3 images (background subtracted Ha1, Ha2, and \r\n> difference).\r\n>\r\nUse the 3 images as layers in a datacube.

No reflections etc. needed.\r\n\r\nLet us look at loss curves.

These images contain four narrowband H-alpha filters for each part of the sky.\r\n\r\n- Segment anything model (SAM) is too slow to be used effectively\r\n\r\n- We will use a CNN (or some other better performing architecture) instead, taking 64x64 pixel images as input, outputting either a probability or binary outcome (0, 1), corresponding to whether the image contains a planetary nebula.\r\n\r\n- The CNN will take 3 images (background subtracted Ha1, Ha2, and difference).\r\n\r\n- Training data will be 64x64 snippets of known planetary nebulae from the HASH database. We will take 128x128 snippets first, then random choose 64x64 cutouts within these, with rotations and reflections.\r\n\r\nI will be in caltech the whole day today - would be happy to discuss with the visitor.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nRyan"

Some initial iterative steps to improve the training sample. In short: create some visualizations to create the first training set - rather than just real or not, you could also have subclasses if they are distinct. Also think of doing multiple binary classifiers, or hierarchical. Maybe you can start with that even before we meet?\r\n\r\nYet to look at the links you provided ...\r\n\r\n-ashish\r\n\r\nOn 8/5/25 10:22 PM, Ryan Lin wrote:\r\nHi Ashish,\r\n\r\nIt would be great to discuss building the ML model - I am free all day tomorrow, and Thursday and Friday afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe full CLU survey data which we’re working with can be viewed through the following website (you can use my login credentials, username: ryanl, password: galaxies). This will allow you to view cropped images of the CLU data for a specified coordinate and fov.\r\n\r\nhttp://gayatri.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/CLU/ImgsearchByCoord.cgi?ra=50&dec=50&con=0.2&fov=50.0&smoothval=2.0\r\n\r\nI have also attached a csv file of the HASH database below, containing all known planetary nebulae. I have found it useful to use the above website to see what known PNe look like in the CLU data (especially the fainter objects) to investigate how to improve the current algorithm’s recall (the fraction of known PNe recovered by the algorithm).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regards to SAM, the following authors fine-tuned SAM on medical images, resulting in some performance increases:\r\n\r\nhttps://openreview.net/pdf?id=BNrWHF5ZlC\r\n\r\nThe issue with SAM is that it only allows points and boxes as prompts, with no natural language prompting. It either outputs prompt-based masks, or unprompted masks (produces one masks for every object identified in an image). My intuition suggests we’d have to generate unprompted masks for our use-case.\r\n\r\nAn issue I’ve been facing in general with the current algorithm is the shear amount of junk detection. This has primarily been due to unmasked stars which remain after subtraction (due to poor chip quality on the edges), cosmic rays, and various other transient phenomena.\r\n\r\nI have 5 weeks left on SURF and would appreciate if you could set me concrete goals to complete each week.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nRyan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 5 Aug 2025, at 20:48, Bhattacharjee, Soumyadeep <sbhatta2@caltech.edu><mailto:sbhatta2@caltech.edu> wrote:\r\n\r\nHello Ryan,\r\n\r\nIt is very unfortunate that Q Parker et al never got back regarding their AI model (I had not expected this). As I mentioned, there are two options. 1) try using SAM, 2) try to build your own CNN for the images. In either of (or both) the cases, Ashish would be the best person to help you. I would encourage you to meet with Ashish and evaluate the two options.\r\n\r\nAshish, I would request you to let Ryan know your availability this week so that he can meet and discuss with you. I am away this week, but I will catch up next week.\r\n\r\nWith regards,\r\nSoumyadeep Bhattacharjee\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Jul 12, 2025, at 10:32 PM, Bhattacharjee, Soumyadeep <sbhatta2@caltech.edu><mailto:sbhatta2@caltech.edu> wrote:\r\n\r\nHello Ashish,\r\n\r\nTuesday 4 PM works for me.\r\n\r\nWe can definitely contact the authors if needed.

So if we are meeting on Tuesday, we can email the authors after the meeting.\r\n\r\nBTW, I just recalled that after my OVRO presentation at Shri’s thinkshop last year, Liam Connor suggested using Segment Anything Method (SAM): https://segment-anything.com/ .

I am trying to write a function that takes as input an ra and dec, and as output spits out all file paths for chip images containing that coordinate, which I believe your code also does - I just don’t understand a few things.\r\n\r\nHow does the AllHaWCSupCals_final.fits file contain all the data in the survey? This doesn’t seem possible given it’s only 90MB in size.\r\n\r\nIt seems you are using decmin, decmax, etc to judge whether a point lies in a chip image. However, this doesn’t take into account that the chip edges may not be aligned with the ra and dec axes, leading to cases where a point does not actually lie in the chip image though it lies in the ra and dec bounds. For example, if the chip image is tilted relative to the ra and dec grids.\r\n\r\nIs there any other data other than the single epoch images that might be useful? I know about the stacked and AllHaWCSupCals_final files - are there any others I should know about?\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nRyan"

We were thinking of including another line in the top left information box, containing data from the PS and Gaia surveys (True if the object crossmatches with a star in the survey, False if not). At the moment it seems the majority of false positives are stars - crossmatching with PS and Gaia (or any other complete star survey that goes down to ~19 mag) could help with this.\r\n\r\nWe can keep the crossmatching distance low since stars are compact and the coordinates outputted by our algorithm seem quite accurate (although an issue could be a detection involving a cluster of stars).\r\n\r\nWanted to hear your thoughts and whether this would be feasible to implement?\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nRyan"

Dave is an astronomer at IPAC and he is in charge of the CLU Ha data. So for any questions related to the data, we will go to him. He has extensive experience in mining the data and is extremely knowledgeable about the various methods that one can use to hunt for diffused and extended sources.\r\n\r\nAshish is an expert in data science and machine learning in Cahill. He is the ML lead for various projects including the Zwicky Transient Facility. He will help us come up with a suitable ML algorithm to hunt for PNe in CLU data.\r\n\r\nDave, Ashish:\r\n\r\nPlease e-meet Ryan Lin, an Oxford sophomore majoring in physics. He will be a SURF student under Shri, working with me on finding nebulae from CLU Ha data. He has an impressive academic track record and has good knowledge in both astronomy and ML. He will be starting here the end of this month.\r\n\r\nI am attaching here the SURF proposal for your reference. Section 3 in the proposal contains the initial plan that we had discussed. It also has the ML reference for planetary nebula that we had in mind (Sun et al. 2024), which has been used on VPHAS+ data.\r\n\r\nI will try to meet with Ashish and Dave sometime soon to discuss some of the basics of the project and work out some preliminary plan. I would also request Dave to let me and Ryan know what we should do to get Ryan access to the data and my codes on Gayatri.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to working together!\r\n\r\nWith regards,\r\nSoumyadeep Bhattacharjee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n--- End Original Email ---\n\n--- Your reply to the original email ---\nDear all,\r\n\r\nNice to meet you all and very excited to work with you this summer!\r\n\r\nIn general, I’m very interested in using machine learning and computational methods to accelerate scientific research, especially with the significant improvements in LLM capabilities recently - I’d be very eager to work on additional opportunities to do so during the project alongside developing the PNe ML algorithm.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I think using LLM agents to automate some of the researcher workflow (e.g. object detection, identification, follow-up observations, hypothesis generation, etc) could be worthwhile. Just throwing an idea out there - let me know if you have any better thoughts!\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nRyan"
